[[resilience]]
= Resilience Features

As of 7.0, the core Spring Framework includes a couple of common resilience features,
in particular `@Retryable` and `@ConcurrencyLimit` annotations for method invocations.


[[resilience-retryable]]
== Using `@Retryable`

`@Retryable` is a common annotation that specifies retry characteristics for an individual
method (with the annotation declared at the method level), or for all proxy-invoked
methods in a given class hierarchy (with the annotation declared at the type level).

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Retryable
public void sendNotification() {
    this.jmsClient.destination("notifications").send(...);
}
----

By default, the method invocation will be retried for any exception thrown: with at
most 3 retry attempts after an initial failure, and a delay of 1 second between attempts.

This can be specifically adapted for every method if necessary â€“ for example, by narrowing
the exceptions to retry:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Retryable(MessageDeliveryException.class)
public void sendNotification() {
    this.jmsClient.destination("notifications").send(...);
}
----

Or for 5 retry attempts and an exponential back-off strategy with a bit of jitter:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Retryable(maxAttempts = 5, delay = 100, jitter = 10, multiplier = 2, maxDelay = 1000)
public void sendNotification() {
    this.jmsClient.destination("notifications").send(...);
}
----

Last but not least, `@Retryable` also works for reactive methods with a reactive
return type, decorating the pipeline with Reactor's retry capabilities:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Retryable(maxAttempts = 5, delay = 100, jitter = 10, multiplier = 2, maxDelay = 1000)
public Mono<Void> sendNotification() {
    return Mono.from(...); // <1>
}
----
<1> This raw `Mono` will get decorated with a retry spec.
	
For details on the various characteristics, see the available annotation attributes
in {spring-framework-api}/resilience/annotation/Retryable.html[`@Retryable`].

NOTE: There a `String` variants with placeholder support available for several attributes
as well, as an alternative to the specifically typed annotation attributes used in the
above examples.


[[resilience-concurrency]]
== Using `@ConcurrencyLimit`

`@ConcurrencyLimit` is an annotation that specifies a concurrency limit for an individual
method (with the annotation declared at the method level), or for all proxy-invoked
methods in a given class hierarchy (with the annotation declared at the type level).

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@ConcurrencyLimit(10)
public void sendNotification() {
    this.jmsClient.destination("notifications").send(...);
}
----

This is meant to protect the target resource from being accessed from too many threads at
the same time, similar to the effect of a pool size limit for a thread pool or a
connection pool that blocks access if its limit is reached.

You may optionally set the limit to 1, effectively locking access to the target bean
instance:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@ConcurrencyLimit(1) // <1>
public void sendNotification() {
    this.jmsClient.destination("notifications").send(...);
}
----
<1> 1 is the default, but specifying it makes the intent clearer.
	
Such limiting is particularly useful with Virtual Threads where there is generally
no thread pool limit in place. For asynchronous tasks, this can be constrained on
{spring-framework-api}/core/task/SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor.html[`SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor`].
For synchronous invocations, this annotation provides equivalent behavior through
{spring-framework-api}/aop/interceptor/ConcurrencyThrottleInterceptor.html[`ConcurrencyThrottleInterceptor`]
which has been available since Spring Framework 1.0 for programmatic use with the AOP
framework.


[[resilience-enable]]
== Configuring `@EnableResilientMethods`

Note that like many of Spring's core annotation-based features, `@Retryable` and
`@ConcurrencyLimit` are designed as metadata that you can choose to honor or ignore.
The most convenient way to enable actual processing of the resilience annotations
through AOP interception is to declare `@EnableResilientMethods` on a corresponding
configuration class. Alternatively, you may declare `RetryAnnotationBeanPostProcessor`
and/or `ConcurrencyLimitBeanPostProcessor` individually.
